## 🎯 What’s Inside / Purpose

- Various **Postman Collections** for REST APIs (e.g. ISBN validation, RESTful Booker)  
- **Test Plans** & **Test Cases** (Excel / sheets) for REST and SOAP APIs  
- Exercises to build understanding of API request/response structure, validation, error handling, edge cases etc.  
- Useful for interview prep, practice / mock tests  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Practiced

- API testing with **Postman**  
- Creating test plans and detailed test cases (positive & negative flows)  
- SOAP & REST fundamentals  
- Structuring tests for real-world APIs  
- Understanding HTTP methods, response codes, JSON / XML format

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SnakeEye15/InterviewQuestions.git
````

2. **Open Postman collections**

   * `IsValidISBN10_Postman_Collection.json`
   * `RESTFul Booker API.postman_collection.json`
     Import into Postman → try running the samples / examples

3. **Review Test Plans / Test Cases**

   * Open the Excel sheets (`.xlsx`) to see structured test cases
   * Open Test Plans for SOAP / REST projects

4. **Practice**

   * Try writing your own test cases / collections based on real APIs
   * Compare with what’s in this repo to improve coverage & detail

---

## 📈 Suggestions for Expanding

* Add more Postman collections (e.g. CRUD apps, authentication, external public APIs)
* Write automated tests (RestAssured / other frameworks) to validate the endpoints in the collections
* Include negative / edge test cases with invalid inputs
* Add documentation: sample HTTP responses, error formats, environment variables, mock servers
* Create a test‐execution report template
