/***
 * Objective:
 *
 * Learn how interfaces support polymorphism â€“ calling the same method on different implementations.
 *
 * ðŸ”¶ Steps:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Create an interface Playable with method play().
 *
 *
 *
 * Create two classes: Guitar and Piano, both implement Playable.
 *
 *
 *
 * Implement the play() method in both classes with different messages.
 *
 *
 *
 * In main(), declare a reference of type Playable and assign it objects of Guitar and Piano one by one.
 *
 *
 *
 * Call play() on each.
 *
 * ðŸ”¶ Expected Output:
 *
 * Playing Guitar
 *
 * Playing Pia
